    <div class="content"><p>&quot;Pre heaven power is a uniquely identifiable power system that cannot be countered with external martial arts.&nbsp; With almost indistinguishable movements, Master Wei-Chung Lin can produce a seemingly immeasurable force.&nbsp; It is unlike traditional methods of fa jin that I have seen in that it can be delivered while talking, sitting, and from any defensive posture.<br />
The training system for pre heaven power is unique in that it identifies key exercises to cultivate this power within.&nbsp; There is no mysticism here, simply practice and refinement.&nbsp; If you follow the exercises and work the system you will cultivate pre heaven power.&nbsp; The world of martial arts is lucky to have such a forward-thinking power delivery method available to the public, as Pre Heaven could have easily been hidden away as a closed system, as is the tradition with such high level practitioners of internal power.&quot;&nbsp;<br />

&quot;After studying martial arts for 23 years, I found the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; of internal power in Pre-Heaven Power.&nbsp;Many Masters have written about and have demonstrated internal power in the past, but have either been unwilling to teach it, or did not have a specific method and system to pass it on to willing practitioners.&nbsp;This problem was solved when I joined AYZYIM.&nbsp;I think it is so amazing is because it is so versatile and the method can be applied to enhance whatever martial arts you are currently studying.&quot;&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;<br />
&quot;To all future students or inquiring-minded martial artists:&nbsp;I have been a student and teacher of internal martial arts for 20 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Never have&nbsp;I seen a system or, structured form of learning as powerful and with such a dramatic results in a short period of time as&nbsp;I expierienced with my Pre-Heaven Power training with Master Wei-Chung Lin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Life comes from breath and power comes from structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent years training with breath because the teachers&nbsp;I trained with in the past need to have me focus on something unattainable to allow years to pass in hopes of me (the student ) finding the secret of developing and using fajing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;kind of training method&nbsp;was used by many teachers and masters in the past who found the secrets the same way through trial and error.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding the secrets through this type of process has one problem, i.e.,&nbsp;when you finally reach success you cannot explain how you got there because you discovered it&nbsp;by accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;I owe much gratitude to Master Lin for making me rethink, rediscover, and find that fajing power&nbsp;I was looking for in such a short period of time with a better understanding than&nbsp;I could have ever imagined.&nbsp; Thank you Master Lin.&quot;<br />

&quot;My name is Agust&iacute;n L&oacute;pez and I attended the seminar on the Pre-Heaven Power Method with Master Wei-Chung Lin.&nbsp; I must say that my experience was very enjoyable and rewarding.&nbsp; Master Lin is a great teacher who enjoys teaching.&nbsp; I could feel his&nbsp;great love for martial arts, and ability to convey your interest in these arts.&nbsp; Also the students and assistant instructors, as well as the rest of<br />
the course participants, were all very helpful and nice. &nbsp;I really liked the atmosphere during the course.</p>
<p>The methods Master Lin taught were very good and I learned many things.&nbsp; I also learned to correctly perform the basic position of Xing Yi Quan; I can understand how I can extract more power for this position.&nbsp; Videos of Master Pan Yue impressed me and made me realize that I was receiving a very special method that any serious martial artist should learn.&nbsp; I sincerely hope that the Master Lin has much success in promoting this wonderful method, and from here I recommend to all those who are serious about martial arts to learn this amazing method.</p>
<p>Finally, I thank Master Lin and all his assistant instructors, the wonderful welcome I received, as well as the help and support throughout.&nbsp; I hope to meet with them on future occasions.&nbsp; Thank you very much everybody.&quot;<br />

&quot;It was a pleasure to meet and attend the workshop with Master Lin and his students.&nbsp;I found the&nbsp;Pre-Heaven Power System to&nbsp;be very practical, with a&nbsp;rich set of training processes and&nbsp;techniques.&nbsp;The weekend was packed with&nbsp;intense, challenging and fun training and I look forward to learning and practicing more of this amazing system.&quot;<br />

&quot;This was an excellent course. &nbsp;Master Lin is a serious, dedicated, and highly skilled martial artist. &nbsp;He has unique insight into the generation of power in the internal martial arts. &nbsp;He is able to demonstrate the effectiveness of his approach during demonstrations and exercises, but more impressively he has formulated an organized curriculum to teach the techniques to his students. &nbsp;A weekend course is too short to be able to master the techniques, but with Master Lin's explanations and guidance, is a very good start to implementing the concepts into the practitioner's practice.&quot;<br />
